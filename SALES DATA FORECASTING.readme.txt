
 FMCG Revenue Forecasting

This repository contains a data analytics project focused on revenue forecasting for Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies. The project uses historical sales data to build predictive models that help estimate future revenue trends.

 Dataset

The dataset used (`fmcg_sales_data.csv`) includes historical FMCG sales across different products, regions, and time periods. Key features include:

- Date – Sales date (monthly or weekly)
- Product_ID – Unique identifier for each product
- Product_Category – Category or type of product (e.g., beverages, snacks)
- Region – Sales region or geography
- Units_Sold – Quantity of product sold
- Unit_Price – Price per unit
- Revenue` – Total sales revenue (`Units_Sold * Unit_Price`)

> Note: The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and date formatting issues before model training.

 Objective

The goal of this project is to forecast future revenue using time series forecasting and regression-based machine learning models.

 Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Prophet / ARIMA for time series analysis (optional)
- Jupyter Notebooks

 Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning – Handle nulls, incorrect data types, and remove duplicates
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyze sales trends, seasonality, product/category performance
3. Feature Engineering- Create lag features, rolling averages, date parts
4. Modeling – Use regression or time series models to forecast revenue
5. Evaluation – Assess performance using MAE, RMSE, MAPE
6. Visualization – Plot forecast vs actual, top-performing products, etc.

Example Visualizations

- Monthly Revenue Trends
- Regional Revenue Distribution
- Top 10 Products by Sales
- Forecast vs Actual Revenue
